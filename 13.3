Answer:

After capturing, Wireshark displays packets in three panes:

Packet List Pane:

Shows summary of all packets captured.

Columns include Time, Source, Destination, Protocol, Length, and Info.

You can select any packet to view more details.

Packet Details Pane:

Displays the breakdown of each packet according to network layers:

Ethernet Header (Data Link Layer)

IP Header (Network Layer)

TCP/UDP Header (Transport Layer)

Data (Application Layer)

Packet Bytes Pane:

Shows the raw data of the selected packet in Hexadecimal and ASCII format.

Example:
When you browse a website, youâ€™ll see packets such as:

TCP Handshake

HTTP GET and Response

DNS Queries and Replies

Conclusion:
Viewing captured traffic helps understand how data travels across the network, step by step.
