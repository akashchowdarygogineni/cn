(iv) Analysis and Statistics & Filters
Answer:

Wireshark provides several tools and filters to analyze captured data.

A. Analysis

You can analyze:

Network delays and packet loss

TCP handshake or retransmissions

Bandwidth usage

Source and destination communication

Wireshark highlights errors like checksum failure, retransmissions, and timeouts in the Info column.

B. Statistics

Wireshark offers a Statistics menu for summarizing data:

Protocol Hierarchy:

Shows the percentage of each protocol (e.g., TCP, UDP, HTTP).

Conversations:

Displays communication between two IP addresses.

Endpoints:

Lists all devices that participated in the communication.

I/O Graphs:

Shows packet traffic over time graphically.

C. Filters

Filters are used to display only specific packets from the capture.

Filter	Description
ip	Shows only IP packets
tcp	Shows only TCP packets
udp	Shows only UDP packets
http	Shows HTTP traffic
ip.addr == 192.168.1.10	Shows packets from/to a specific IP
tcp.port == 80	Shows packets using port 80 (HTTP)

Example:
Typing http in the filter bar will display only HTTP-related packets.

Result / Conclusion:

Using Wireshark, we can successfully:

Capture network packets

View detailed traffic

Apply filters for protocol-based analysis

Generate statistics for understanding network performance

Wireshark is an essential tool for network engineers, security analysts, and students to understand real-time communication.
