(i) Packet Capture Using Wireshark
Answer:

Packet capture is the process of collecting and recording data packets that travel across a computer network.
Wireshark is a packet capture and analysis tool that allows users to view these packets in detail.

Steps to capture packets:

Open the Wireshark application.

Select the network interface (e.g., Wi-Fi or Ethernet).

Click on the Start Capturing Packets button (blue shark fin icon).

Perform some network activity like browsing a website.

Stop capturing by clicking the Red square (Stop) button.

Wireshark will display all captured packets with details such as time, source, destination, protocol, and length.

Purpose:
To analyze real-time data communication and understand how different network protocols work.

Example:
When you open a webpage, Wireshark captures packets like:

DNS Request → Resolving domain name

TCP Handshake → SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK

HTTP GET → Requesting the webpage
